## Hamilton–Jacobi Equations (with Prof. Hung Tran, UW–Madison)
- Focus: viscosity solutions, vanishing viscosity method, and Perron’s method.  
- Current work: improving convergence rates in degenerate viscous Hamilton–Jacobi equations (from \(O(\sqrt{\varepsilon})\) toward \(O(\varepsilon \log \varepsilon)\)).
