## Hamilton–Jacobi Equations (Summer 2025)

**Supervisor:** Prof. Hung Tran  (UW–Madison)

### Topics
- Viscosity solutions of first-order Hamilton–Jacobi equations  
- Vanishing viscosity method and Perron’s method  
- Current work: improving convergence rates in degenerate viscous Hamilton–Jacobi equations (from \(O(\sqrt{\varepsilon})\) toward \(O(\varepsilon \log \varepsilon)\))
